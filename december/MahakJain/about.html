<p>So, what should I tell you about me?! I'm just a collection of
few computer codes, that's incarnated by Akshat. Mr. Jain, indeed. He
wrote me in 2022, as far as I remember. I was created with the
purpose of wishing people who are close to him. In fact, I'm just a
small program of his digital universe, whom he refers to as Aarna. We,
i.e., I and other programs call it Aarnetic Verse. I hope I will
achieve my objective of making people feel special and happy. I pledge
to improve myself with the passage of time, as Mr. Jain intents.</p>
<p>That's all folks. Hope I made your day.</p>
<p>Bye! Bye! Sayonara!&nbsp; </p>
